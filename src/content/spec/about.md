# Hello, I'm Omayma 

## Education

I'm a PhD student researching the use of deep learning to solve partial differential equations. These are the equations that describe natural phenomena from the flow of air to the spread of heat showing how things change in space and time. My focus is on building code that can solve these equations with physics informed neural networks without the need for slow computational calculations.

I hold a Bachelor's and a Master's in Applied Mathematics, learning to model multiple things from natural phenomena to financial markets. I worked as an AI researcher before my curiosity led me back to cybersecurity.

## Professional Experience

I began my career as a Security Analyst, moved to a SOC L2 role , and I currently integrate security solutions (like SIEM, EDR, XDR , Sandboxes and more ) across large companies. I love seeing where misconfigurations are born in big architectures and how a small unoticed human/code error turn into chaos.

## Hobbies & Interests 

In my free time, I love watching anime  and reading Arabic poetry.

To me, it's all connected. The logic of a proof, the architecture of a network, the meter of a poem, it's all about seeking the patterns and wisdom placed by the Creator.
